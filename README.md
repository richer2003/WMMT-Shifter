# WMMT-Shifter
Arduino code to use a 6 speed shifter from a Maximum Tune arcade machine as a USB game controller.

Include the Arduino Joystick Library by, "MHeironimus." https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
The Joystick library can only be used with a USB MCU (e.g. Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Micro, etc.)

To use the shifter as an Xinput device, use "XOutput" by "csutorasa." https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput
